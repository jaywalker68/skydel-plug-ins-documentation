# Introduction

Welcome to the Skydel plug-ins documentation!

Have a feature request for Skydel? Thinking about what you can work on yourself? Excellent! Teaming with Skydel has never been easier! With the addition of this new plug-in framework, users can now develop features and integrate them into the Skydel user interface and real-time simulation engine.

If you want to  start working on your own Skydel plug-in, the first step is to follow the instructions of how to setup the development environment on either in [Ubuntu](development-environment/ubuntu-18.md) or [Windows](development-environment/windows-10.md).

If need help figuring out how plug-ins are integrated in Skydel, then have a look at this [page ](plug-ins-in-skydel/using-plugins.md)explains it all.
